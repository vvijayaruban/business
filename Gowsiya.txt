I am writing to express my interest in the Catering Assistant position at Netherhall Rawthorpe ST James I & N. I have experience working in food service environments through voluntary roles that align well with the requirements of this role.

From 2011 to 2015, I volunteered and managed the kitchen at South Harrow Tamil School, where I was responsible for preparing and serving meals, maintaining food hygiene, and ensuring smooth operation during school events. This experience gave me valuable insights into food preparation and safety regulations in a fast-paced environment.

Since 2018, I have also volunteered at South Yorkshire Tamil Sunday Schools, where I continue to support the kitchen team with meal preparation and serving duties. These roles allowed me to develop strong organizational and teamwork skills, as well as an ability to work efficiently under pressure while maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene.

I am confident that my previous experience in similar environments will enable me to contribute effectively to your team. I am excited about the opportunity to work with you and look forward to discussing my application further.

Thank you for considering my application.

In my volunteer roles at both South Harrow Tamil School (2011-2015) and South Yorkshire Tamil Sunday Schools (from 2018), I worked closely with a team to ensure efficient kitchen operations. We collaborated on meal preparation, serving, and maintaining cleanliness, always communicating to meet the needs of the school community.

To contribute to good team working, I ensured clear communication, making sure everyone was aware of their tasks and supported where needed. I took initiative by organizing kitchen schedules, ensuring tasks were evenly distributed, and stepping in to assist others during busy periods. I also focused on fostering a positive atmosphere, encouraging collaboration and problem-solving when challenges arose.

By working together, we were able to deliver meals efficiently and maintain a high standard of hygiene, ensuring a smooth-running kitchen that met everyone’s needs.

To ensure customers receive excellent service, I focus on three key areas: attentiveness, efficiency, and communication.

First, I make sure to actively listen to customers, paying attention to their needs or concerns, and responding promptly to ensure they feel valued. Whether it's addressing dietary preferences or answering questions about the food being served, I aim to be approachable and helpful at all times.

Second, I prioritize efficiency by keeping the kitchen and service areas well-organized, which helps minimize waiting times and ensures customers receive their meals promptly. I understand the importance of delivering food that is fresh, hot, and presented well, and I work diligently to meet those standards.

Lastly, clear communication with both the team and customers is vital. By maintaining a positive and respectful interaction with customers, I create an inviting atmosphere that encourages feedback, which can be used to improve the service further.

My goal is always to provide a seamless experience where customers feel satisfied and appreciated.

I do not currently have a Food Hygiene Certificate, but I am very willing to attain this certification. I understand the importance of maintaining high standards of food safety and hygiene in a catering environment, and I am eager to complete the necessary training to ensure compliance with regulations and to further enhance my skills.

I have not yet been involved in making changes at work, but if given the opportunity, I would focus on improving communication and task delegation within the team. Clear communication ensures that everyone knows their responsibilities, which can lead to faster service and better coordination. For example, I would suggest regular check-ins during shifts to ensure tasks are evenly distributed, minimizing delays and ensuring children receive a higher standard of service.

I would approach the child with a friendly and reassuring attitude, offering a warm smile and gentle words to help them feel comfortable. I would explain what’s on the menu in a simple way, give them time to choose, and encourage them by telling them how tasty the food is. If they seem unsure, I would offer smaller portions to start and let them know they can ask for more if they like it. By being patient and kind, I’d help them feel more relaxed and enjoy their meal.
