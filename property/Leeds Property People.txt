Mortgage Repayment: This will be your biggest monthly outgoing cost. BTL mortgages are often interest-only, meaning you only pay the interest on the loan each month, not the capital amount. This can make the monthly payments seem lower, but you'll still need to repay the entire loan amount at the end of the mortgage term.

Letting Agent Fees (optional): If you choose to use a letting agent to manage your property, they will charge a monthly fee, typically a percentage of the monthly rent.

Landlord Insurance: This is essential to cover yourself against various risks such as damage to the property, unpaid rent, and tenant liability.

Council Tax: You'll be responsible for paying council tax on your BTL property.

Utilities: Depending on your tenancy agreement, you might be responsible for paying some or all of the utilities for the property, such as water, electricity, and gas.

Maintenance and Repairs: Budget for unexpected repairs and general maintenance of the property. A rule of thumb is to set aside around 10% of your annual rental income for this purpose.

Ground Rent and Service Charges (if applicable):  These charges may apply to leasehold properties or properties in a development with shared amenities.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

Vacancy Periods:  There may be periods when the property is unoccupied between tenants. Factor in the loss of rental income during these times.

Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES):  Since April 2018, it's illegal to rent out a property in the UK with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating below E.  You may need to make improvements to the property to meet this standard, which could involve additional costs.
